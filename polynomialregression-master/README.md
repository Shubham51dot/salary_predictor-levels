# Polynomial Regression

## Polynomial Regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable x and dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x)

#### These are basically used to define or describe non-linear phenomenon such as:

1. Growth rate of tissues.
2. Progression of disease epidemics
3. Distribution of carbon isotopes in lake sediments
